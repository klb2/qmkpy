This software package primarily aims at research in the areas of operations
research and optimization.
It provides a way of quickly implementing and testing new algorithms to solve
the quadratic multiple knapsack problem (QMKP) and compare it with existing
solutions.


## Problem Description
The QMKP is defined as the following combinatorial optimization problem

$$
\begin{alignat}{3}
	\max\quad & \sum_{u\in\mathcal{K}}\Bigg(\sum_{i\in\mathcal{A}(u)} p_{i} &+&\sum_{\substack{j\in\mathcal{A}(u), \\ j\neq i}} p_{ij}\Bigg)\\
	\mathrm{s.t.}\quad & \sum_{i\in\mathcal{A}(u)} w_{i} \leq c_u & \quad & \forall u\in\mathcal{K} \\
	& \sum_{u=1}^{K} a_{iu} \leq 1  & & \forall 1\leq i \leq N
\end{alignat}
$$

This describes an assignment problem where one wants to assign $N$ items to $K$
knapsacks. If item $i$ is assigned to a knapsack, it yields the profit $p_i$.
If item $j$ (with $j\neq i$ ) is assigned _to the same_ knapsack, we get the
additional joint profit $p_{ij}$.

## Features

- Quick and simple creation of QMKP instances
- Saving/loading of problem instances for a simple creation and use of
  reference datasets
- Easy implementation of novel algorithms to solve the QMKP
- High reproducibility and direct comparison between different algorithms


## Installation
