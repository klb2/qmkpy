Welcome to QMKPy's documentation!
=================================

**QMKPy** is a Python library for modeling and solving quadratic multiple
knapsack problems (QMKP).
It provides a framework that allows quickly implementing and testing novel
algorithms to solve the QMKP.
It is therefore primarily targeting researchers working in the area of
operations research/optimization.

Additionally, it can be used to easily generate datasets of QMKP instances
which can be used as reference test set to fairly compare different algorithms.
