Getting Started
===============
In the following, a few simple examples are shown.


Basic Usage
-----------
The following script contains an example in which a QMKP is defined and solved
by the implemented constructive procedure.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Defining and Solving a QMKP
   :linenos:

   import numpy as np
   from qmkpy import total_profit_qmkp, QMKProblem
   from qmkpy import algorithms

   weights = [5, 2, 3, 4]  # four items
   capacities = [10, 5, 12, 4, 2]  # five knapsacks
   profits = np.array([[3, 1, 0, 2],
                       [1, 1, 1, 4],
                       [0, 1, 2, 2],
                       [2, 4, 2, 3]])  # symmetric profit matrix

   qmkp = QMKProblem(profits, weights, capacities)
   qmkp.algorithm = algorithms.constructive_procedure
   assignments, total_profit = qmkp.solve()

   print(assignments)
   print(total_profit)


Saving a Problem Instance
-------------------------
It is possible to save a problem instance of a QMKP. This can be useful to
share examples as a benchmark dataset to compare different algorithms.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Saving a QMKProblem Instance
   :linenos:

   import numpy as np
   from qmkpy import QMKProblem

   weights = [5, 2, 3, 4]  # four items
   capacities = [10, 5, 12, 4, 2]  # five knapsacks
   profits = np.array([[3, 1, 0, 2],
                       [1, 1, 1, 4],
                       [0, 1, 2, 2],
                       [2, 4, 2, 3]])  # symmetric profit matrix

   qmkp = QMKProblem(profits, weights, capacities)

   # Save the problem instance using the Numpy npz format
   qmkp.save("my_problem.npz", strategy="numpy") 


Loading a Saved QMKProblem Instance
-----------------------------------
You can also load a previously saved QMKProblem instance to get a
:class:`qmkpy.QMKProblem` object with the same profits, weights and weight
capacities.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Loading a Saved QMKProblem
   :linenos:

   from qmkpy import QMKProblem

   saved_problem = "my_problem.npz"  # saved model file
   qmkp = QMKProblem.load(saved_problem, strategy="numpy")
